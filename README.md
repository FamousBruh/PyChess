# PyChess

This was honestly one of the most difficult things I have ever done, it was my first time using OOP without having someone do all the heavy lifting for me.

It was incredibly stressful, and I have no idea if it even works properly, it doesn't even have en passant or castling.

Black is lowercase white is uppercase white starts first, most other chess rules apply, such as promotion.
